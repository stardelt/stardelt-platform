"""Turn `Catalog` objects into Lakekeeper warehouses with grants (authz 4/8, 5/8).

Runs inside the cluster as CronJob `access-sync` (every 2 minutes). The design
(`design/multitenant-catalogs.md` §4.2, §5.2–§5.7, §7.2 P2a) gives this loop to the
operator; the operator builds objects and Jobs only and has no HTTP client (no
`CATALOG_*` environment), so a CronJob does it until the operator absorbs it.
Nothing here belongs in the operator's Catalog controller, which stays a dry-run
planner.

For every `Catalog` in the namespace, one line on stdout:

* `created` / `exists` — a Lakekeeper warehouse of that name exists afterwards. An
  existing warehouse is adopted untouched (no storage change, status only), which is
  how the pre-existing `warehouse` joins the model without a migration.
* `invalid <reason>` — the object breaks a rule, so no warehouse is created and the
  status says why. This is a verdict, not a job failure: the Catalog carries the error.
* `failed <detail>` — Lakekeeper refused the create; the tick exits non-zero so the
  CronJob's backoff and the failed Job are visible.

Then the grants (platform#306): a Keycloak group becomes a Lakekeeper role of the
same name, its members are that role's `assignee`s by OIDC `sub` (`oidc~<sub>`, valid
before a person has ever signed in), and the Catalog's `grants` become grants on the
warehouse — which Lakekeeper inherits downward to every namespace, table and view,
existing and future. The verb map (architect decision 2026-10-20 included):

    browse -> describe        select -> select            write -> modify
    create -> create          manage -> manage_grants     (never `ownership`)

`manage` is `manage_grants` because Lakekeeper's `ownership` includes every data
right, and managing a catalog must not imply reading it; dropping or renaming needs
`write`. The owner group gets `manage_grants` and nothing else (§5.3: ownership does
not imply select).

The sync owns only what it created: roles whose description starts with
`stardelt group `, nothing else — a role with a foreign description is reported as a
conflict and never edited. Grants on a managed warehouse held by a role this job
manages that the spec does not declare are removed; grants held by anything else
(the project-level `data_admin` of the platform's service accounts, a person's
ownership, a person) are left alone and only *counted* in the Catalog's `Drift`
condition (reason plus count, no names). The sync's own `ownership` on a warehouse it
created (`own_user_id()`, the creator tuple Lakekeeper writes) is its own record and
is not drift.

The admin group (`ADMIN_GROUP`, default `stardelt-admins`) is always managed: its
role exists, holds its members, and is a `project_admin` of the project, so every
platform administrator has that through the group instead of one grant per person.
`STATIC_ASSIGNEES` (`{"<group>": ["<principal>"]}`, default `{}`) adds assignees that
have no Keycloak user — tonight the PASSWORD account `superset` — as
`oidc~<principal>`; entries for groups no Catalog declares are ignored.

Status is written through the `status` subresource as a merge-patch, and only when it
differs from the live status — a converged tick must not bump `resourceVersion`
(`make access-sync-now` twice leaves it alone). The job owns the `CatalogReady`,
`GrantsReady` and `Drift` conditions and leaves any other condition untouched.

The Keycloak side is read-only and always happens before the first write, so a realm
that refuses this client (401/403) fails the tick with nothing written. A declared
group that does not exist in the realm is a verdict (`GrantsReady=False`,
`reason=UnknownGroup`), not a failed tick — the same rule as `Invalid`.

Tonight only prefix mode is built: every catalog shares the platform bucket (Secret
`stardelt-s3-creds`) and `storage.keyPrefix` (default: the catalog name) separates the
data. A `storage.bucket` that is not the platform bucket is
`Invalid/BucketsNotBuilt` — storage isolation cannot be enforced anyway until
per-catalog buckets exist (`design/multitenant-catalogs.md` §2.4; spike platform#272
showed CopyObject bypasses bucket scoping), and users never hold storage credentials.

Deleting a Catalog never deletes its warehouse or its data (design §2.5): a warehouse
without a Catalog is only reported, as one `orphan warehouse <name>` line per tick.

A `SqlWarehouse` is a named compute class inside the one Trino (design §3.2–§3.5,
spike platform#273): the object becomes a **resource group** of the coordinator, its
granted groups' members become the members of a `wh-<name>` group in the file group
provider, and the person's class is then chosen by their identity — never by a header
they send. Two ConfigMaps carry the result, and from this ticket on this job is the
single writer of both:

* `trino-warehouses`, key `resource-groups.json` — the file the coordinator loads
  **once** (spike R6; a changed file needs a restart, ticket 2/3). Root group `global`
  (90% memory, 100 running, 500 queued) holds one `wh-<name>` sub group per rendered
  warehouse; root group `admin` (100%, 50, 100) is where the admin group lands; root
  group `no-warehouse` (0%, 0, 0) is the catch-all when no warehouse is the default,
  so an unassigned person gets Trino's explicit `Too many queued queries for
  "no-warehouse"` instead of silently sharing a class.
* `trino-group-file`, key `groups.txt` — the file group provider (re-read within 30 s,
  no restart): the `stardelt-admins` line the query-visibility rules have always used,
  plus one `wh-<name>:<subs>` line per rendered warehouse, members sorted.

The class defaults are the architect decision of this ticket — `xs` 2/10/10%, `small`
10/100/20%, `medium` 5/50/40%, `large` 6/70/70%, scheduling `fair` — and the spec's
`concurrency` overrides each field. The classes partition the one coordinator and
worker (2 GiB heaps each): they queue and share fairly, they do not add hardware.

Selectors are **identity first** (spike R3/R5/R8): the admin group first, then one
`userGroup: wh-<name>` selector per rendered warehouse from the largest size to the
smallest (name order inside a size — the first selector that matches wins, so a person
in two granted groups lands in the bigger class), then a catch-all to the one warehouse
with `default: true`, or to `no-warehouse` when zero or two are marked default. A
selector that carries `clientTags` without `userGroup` is spoofable and therefore
refused here outright (`selector()` raises) — the renderer never writes one, and a unit
test iterates the rendered document to prove it.

Rules a `SqlWarehouse` breaks are verdicts, not failed ticks (the Catalog pattern): the
name must be 1 to 40 lower-case letters, digits and dashes, starting with a letter and
not ending in a dash (the operator's `SqlWarehouseSpec::validate`); a group may appear
once in `grants`; `concurrency.running` is 1 to 100 and `queued` 0 to 10000;
`memoryShare` is `1%` to `100%`; `size` is one of the four classes; a granted group
must exist in the realm. Two `default: true` objects make **both** Invalid
(`TwoDefaults`) rather than picking one. An invalid warehouse is skipped with a line on
stdout, and every other warehouse still renders.

The status is written through the `status` subresource as a merge-patch and only when it
differs from the live one: `phase` `Ready`/`Invalid`, `renderedGroup` `wh-<name>` (null
when Invalid), `engine` `trino@default`, and the condition `Rendered`. Conditions this
job does not own are preserved.

Standard library only (the image is plain `python:slim-bookworm`). The S3 secret
travels only in the create body; logs carry catalog names, group names, counts and
HTTP status codes, never principals, subjects, usernames, tokens, keys or response
bodies (a create body is the one place the storage key appears, and a response body
can echo it).

After the grants of a tick are written, the same information is published as OPA
data at `OPA_DATA_URL` (`http://lakekeeper-opa:8282/v1/data/stardelt/access`,
platform#359):

    {"generatedAt": <epoch seconds>,
     "catalogs": {"<name>": {"drift": false,
                             "all":    [<subs of the admin group>],
                             "browse": [...], "select": [...],
                             "write":  [...], "create": [...]}}}

The bridge's front rule (`stardelt.front.rego`) answers the catalog-level
authorization questions from it, so `SHOW CATALOGS` and every query stop paying
~0.15 s per catalog to Lakekeeper. The table is derived from the same `Catalog`
objects this job writes to Lakekeeper and is an ACCELERATOR only: the bridge
falls back to Lakekeeper when it is stale, when a catalog is missing from it, or
when that catalog carries a foreign grant (`drift`). The verb implications are
applied here, once (Lakekeeper's model: `modify` implies `select` implies
`describe`, `create` implies `describe`), and every list holds the exact string
Trino sends as the user — the Keycloak `sub`, or a bare `STATIC_ASSIGNEES`
principal (`superset`) without the `oidc~` prefix. A failed push is logged and
never fails the tick. A tick that removes a grant drops the document first
(`invalidate_access_table`), so the bridge asks Lakekeeper until the next publish
instead of answering from a table that still lists the removed grant (platform#384).
